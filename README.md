# TSym
 Text based symbol format for Ghidra and (soon) IDA

## Features
 - [ ] Import headers instead of inlining the entire path (will take a while)
 - [ ] Detect classes and add methods (both normal and virtual) to the headers
 - [ ] Local names
 - [ ] Support my `inherit` field name (used in place of extending so Ghidra will enjoy it)
